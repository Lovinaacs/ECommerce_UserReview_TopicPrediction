# E-Commerce Application User Review TopicPrediction
This repository focuses on predicting topics from user reviews of e-commerce applications, leveraging advanced text mining techniques. It includes a Google Play Store review scraper that gathers unstructured user review data. The collected data undergoes preprocessing, including cleaning, normalization, and tokenization, before being transformed into numerical representations using Bag-of-Words (BoW) and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) methods. Topic modeling is performed using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) to uncover prevalent themes in user feedback. The repository features code for both LDA and LSA models, enabling effective analysis of user sentiments and experiences, thereby providing valuable insights for developers and enhancing user decision-making in selecting e-commerce applications.

## Additional Information
The code within this repository was developed as part of a final project for a university course on text mining. This course provided the foundational knowledge and skills necessary to explore the application of text analysis techniques to real-world data. The project aims to deepen understanding of text mining methodologies while demonstrating their practical implementation through the analysis of consumer feedback. This academic endeavor not only showcases the capabilities of advanced modeling techniques but also emphasizes the importance of extracting actionable insights from unstructured data to improve user experiences in e-commerce applications.
